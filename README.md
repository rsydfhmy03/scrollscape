## Implementation Details

### Core Concepts
This project implements several important concepts in modern front-end development:

#### 1. Centralized State Management
- Utilizes **Zustand** for all global state management (image data, loading status, application mode, etc.)
- Chosen for minimal boilerplate compared to Redux while providing powerful state management via hooks

#### 2. Custom Hooks for Reusable Logic
- **`useInfiniteScroll`**: Abstracts **Intersection Observer API** logic into a clean custom hook
- **`useDebounce`**: Prevents API calls on every keystroke in `SearchBar`, improving efficiency

#### 3. Modular Component Architecture
- Components divided by functionality (`ImageCard`, `ImageGrid`, `SearchBar`, `ImageModal`)
- Ensures clean, maintainable, and reusable code structure

## Performance & SEO Optimization

Performance is not an added feature but a core principle of this project.

#### Performance Optimizations
- ‚úÖ **Modern Image Formats**: Requests images in **WebP** format from API (30-50% smaller than JPEG)
- ‚úÖ **Loading Prioritization**: Above-the-fold images load aggressively (`loading="eager"`, `fetchpriority="high"`)
- ‚úÖ **Lazy Loading**: Below-the-fold images deferred (`loading="lazy"`)
- ‚úÖ **Code Splitting**: Heavy components like `ImageModal` loaded dynamically via `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
- ‚úÖ **Tree-Shaking for Animations**: Uses `LazyMotion` from Framer Motion to include only necessary animation code
- ‚úÖ **Preconnect to Critical Domains**: Uses `<link rel="preconnect">` for faster connections to image CDN
- ‚úÖ **Self-Hosted Fonts**: Local font hosting eliminates external network requests that block rendering

#### SEO Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Meta Tags**: Relevant `meta description` for improved search result appearance
- ‚úÖ **`robots.txt`**: Valid `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers
